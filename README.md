# tic-tac-toe
A classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (typically "X" and "O"). The player who succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
